# Ironhack-HTML-and-CSS-Module-exercise
This is the HTML & CSS section of my pre-work for Web Dev in Ironhack - To get some practice with both web dev and GitHub

As shown before, this website is not optimized, so it changes and de-formats if we zoom-in or zoom-out, 
so it needs to be in its normal size.

One note on the buttons, I created buttons within hyperlinks.

Buttons are used when submitting a form, and hyperlinks are used to move from 
one page to the other or to move within the page.

My train of thought is, non of the buttons present in this project are submitting information or forms, 
thus they are not buttons per se.
They are, however, sending you to another page to proceed with "sign up of NPM" & "sign up for orgs".

When it comes to the "Install NPM" hyperlink, I used the HTML <a> download attribute, 
which allows the file to be downloaded directly when clicking the hyperlink.

I have also created buttons within the hyperlinks, because this would be the fastest way to
create hyperlinks that look like buttons, and to style them.
